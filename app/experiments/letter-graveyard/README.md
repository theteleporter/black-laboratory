# Letter Graveyard | Black Labs

**Letter Graveyard** is an interactive experiment where a textarea's text is deleted and the individual characters fall into a "letter graveyard." It's a fun way to visualize the deletion of text in a creative and engaging manner.

## Demo

In the demo, type something into the text area, and when you delete the text, watch the letters fall down into a letter graveyard.

## Features

- **Text Area**: A fully functional textarea for inputting text.
- **Dynamic Letter Animation**: When you delete the text, the characters fall into a "graveyard," adding a creative twist to text deletion.
- **Interactive**: Type and delete freely, watching as each letter falls into its own space when erased.
