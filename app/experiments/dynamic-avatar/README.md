# Dynamic Avatar | Black Labs

This experiment generates a dynamic avatar based on the input email address. The avatar's gradient colors change according to the length of the email provided.

## Features

- **Dynamic Gradient Avatar**: The avatarâ€™s colors update automatically as the email is typed.
- **Email Input**: Enter an email to see the avatar update its colors dynamically.
- **Responsive**: The avatar and input field adapt to different screen sizes.

## How It Works

1. The input email is used to generate a unique color gradient based on the length of the email or on every keystroke.
2. The avatar updates its colors using a CSS linear gradient.
3. The design and avatar will update as you type a new email.
