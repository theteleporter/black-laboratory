# Word Art | Black Labs

## Description
**Word Art** is a content-editable 2D text experiment inspired by [rauchg](https://rauchg.com) and a developer in Asia. It allows users to interact with the text by dragging it around the screen and modifying its appearance. The text features a gradient color effect and a 3D perspective effect that responds to dragging. The text is also editable, providing a fun and customizable experience.

## Features
- **Editable Text**: The text is editable, allowing users to modify the text directly in the browser.
- **Interactive Dragging**: Click and drag the text to see it react with a 3D perspective.
- **Gradient Text**: The text has a vibrant gradient effect, making it visually appealing.
- **Responsive Design**: The design adapts to different screen sizes, with optimized behavior for both mobile and desktop devices.

## How It Works
- **Dragging**: As you drag the text around, it adjusts its 3D perspective (rotation in X and Y axes), creating an interactive and dynamic visual experience.
- **Text Editing**: By clicking on the text, you can begin editing it directly in the browser. Once you're done editing, simply press Enter or click outside to save the changes.
- **Responsive Adjustments**: On mobile devices, the dragging sensitivity and text effects adjust to fit the screen size and ensure a smooth experience.

## Usage

Once the experiment is loaded, you can:

- **Drag** the text around the screen: Click and hold the mouse or use your touchpad to move the text in any direction. The text will tilt in 3D based on the drag direction, providing a unique interactive experience.
  
- **Click** on the text to start editing it: By clicking on the text, you can make it editable. This allows you to change the content of the text directly within the interface. To save your changes, simply press **Enter** or click outside the text box.

- **Use your mouse or touch screen** to interact: On mobile, the text can be dragged and edited the same way. The dragging sensitivity adjusts for touch devices to ensure smooth interaction.

- **Edit the text's appearance**: As you drag the text, the 3D perspective effect is applied, making the text appear to tilt and skew. You can change the text's content, color, and perspective by interacting with it.
